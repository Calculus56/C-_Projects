We start with an id
Example ID:50

We want to store 8 booleans in a byte to save space.
To find the row we use ID/8 and to find the index of the byte we use ID%8 to get the remiander.
* NOTE after we get the remainder we need to use reverse indexing to go from last to first index.
We do this by using (7-remainder)
